### [Array.Sort Method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6tf1f0bc(v=vs.110).aspx)
Each element of array must implement the IComparable interface to be capable of comparisons with every other element in array.
If the sort is not successfully completed, the results are undefined.
This method uses the introspective sort (introsort) algorithm as follows:

If the partition size is fewer than 16 elements, it uses an insertion sort algorithm.

If the number of partitions exceeds 2 * LogN, where N is the range of the input array, it uses a Heapsort algorithm.

Otherwise, it uses a Quicksort algorithm.
